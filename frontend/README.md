# Frontend

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

To execute unit tests with Jasmine and Karma:

```bash
ng test
```

### End-to-End Tests

This project uses Playwright for E2E testing:

```bash
# Run E2E tests (headless)
npm run test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with browser visible
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run E2E tests in interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

For comprehensive testing documentation including backend unit and integration tests, see [TESTING.md](../TESTING.md) in the repository root.
